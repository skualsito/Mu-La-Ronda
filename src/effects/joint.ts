/**
 * Joint - a glowing ribbon that jitters while it lives: a lightning bolt, a
 * chain of energy, a spirit tether, a streamer. The original's
 * `CreateJoint(BITMAP_JOINT_*, from, to, …)` (ZzzEffectJoint.cpp) comes in
 * two shapes and both live here:
 *
 *  - **bolt**: a strip of `segments` points between two ends, re-pointed
 *    every tick with noise (JOINT_THUNDER, JOINT_HEALING, the beams);
 *  - **trail**: a *head* that moves (`Velocity` per tick along `Angle`, or
 *    pinned to a bone) and drags its last `MaxTails` positions behind it
 *    (JOINT_SPIRIT streamers, the FLASH ribbon dropping from the sky, the
 *    five MODEL_SPEARSKILL ribbons that orbit a Soul Barrier).
 *
 * One `GreasedLine` per joint in the joint's colour, glow-layer referenced so
 * it blooms like the item crackle. Both ends of a bolt may move, and `forks`
 * grows side branches for Lightning.
 *
 * A joint with a `texture` is drawn the way `RenderJoints` draws its tail
 * quads: the BITMAP_JOINT_* sheet runs U along the ribbon (per tail slot, not
 * per world distance - ZzzEffectJoint.cpp:7036), V across it, × the joint's
 * `Light`. The sheets are black at the edges, so under the additive blend only
 * the bright filament in the middle shows - an untextured ribbon is a solid
 * band of colour the full width of the quad strip, which is what every bolt
 * looked like (issue #4). Untextured stays supported for the plain glow
 * ribbons (aura's orbit lines).
 *
 * Driven by: `effects.spawn('joint', …)`; `aura.ts` spawns the persistent
 * orbit ribbons through `spawnJoint`. Read by: nobody.
