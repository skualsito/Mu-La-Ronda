 * What a signup has to look like before anyone bothers the database.
 *
 * Three places ask the question: the login window's register form, the
 * standalone page (`register/src`), and the service itself
 * (`register/server/main.ts`), which re-checks all of it because anything can
 * POST to it. The two forms share this file so a rule tightened for one is not
 * quietly looser in the other.
 *
 * It answers with a *reason*, never a sentence: the client renders it through
 * `t()` and the standalone page through its own English, and neither wants a
 * string the other chose. Engine-free, like `rateLimit.ts` beside it - nothing
 * here may drag Babylon or a store into a server process.
