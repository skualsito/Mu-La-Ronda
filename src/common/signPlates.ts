/**
 * The signpost plates — the small wooden notice boards the map objects carry,
 * and the one place the fake script on them is replaced by a real name.
 *
 * Every signpost in the game draws its writing from one of three 64x64
 * textures: `notice` (Lorencia / Stadium / Valley of Loren), `snotice` (its
 * snowed-over twin in Devias and Santa Town) and `snotice02` (the two-plank
 * road sign, which carries *two* boards in one texture). The lettering baked
 * into all three is decorative nonsense — `Nosdodsodo`, `Kimurj`, `Muy` —
 * drawn at 64x64, so it was never readable as anything else.
 *
 * What happens here: the original texture is fetched once, drawn into a canvas
 * eight times its size, the title band of each board is patched over with a
 * clean strip of its own plank, and the real name is written across it. The
 * result is a `DynamicTexture` bound per mesh through `metadata.diffuseTexture`
 * (itemMaterial.ts) — the shared material is untouched, so two signs a tile
 * apart can read different things.
 *
 * The rest of the texture is copied through at `NEAREST` and is byte-identical
 * to what the sign drew before: only the title band changes.
 *
 * Read by `signObject.ts`. The label strings come from `signLabels.ts`.
