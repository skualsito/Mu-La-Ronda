 * Installing changes nothing about how the game renders - it is the same
 * engine in a window without a tab strip. What it is worth is the icon on the
 * taskbar and, because an installed app is granted persistent storage without
 * asking, the assets the download screen fetched surviving a browser that is
 * short on disk.
 *
 * The only module that touches the install APIs, and it imports nothing from
 * the app so `main.tsx` can pull it in before the game version resolves.
