 *

 * keyed only to find the silhouette's outline. MU's TGAs carry partial alpha
 * across whole surfaces and not just along a key's edge - a cape's weave, a
 * skirt's hem, a wing membrane, a helmet's visor - and at 0.25 every one of

 * their overlap ran out shows as a bright hairline of unshadowed ground -
 * around the neck, at each elbow and knee, where a boot meets a shin. A
 * shadow that ought to be one shape arrives as a pile of parts.
 *
 * Growing each piece by a hair along its own normal makes the overlaps deep
 * enough to survive being flattened, and the seams close. Only the horizontal
 * part of the normal is used, because the vertical part cannot change a
 * silhouette that has already been squashed flat - see the vertex block.
