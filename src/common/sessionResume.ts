/**
 * Getting back in after the connection drops.
 *
 * A browser client loses its socket for reasons a desktop one never sees: a
 * sleeping tab, a lid closing, a proxy restart, a phone changing network.
 * The old path for all of them was the same as a kick - back to the server
 * list, log in again, pick the character again.
 *
 * This walks that flow on its own instead: dial the game server we were on,
 * send the same login the form would send, then select the character we were
 * playing. Nothing new goes on the wire; the packets are the ones the login
 * screens already send, in the same order. Credentials are the ones already
 * in the store for the session - nothing extra is written to disk.
 *
 * Guard rails: only after a socket we did not close ourselves went away,
 * only while a character was actually in the world, a handful of attempts
 * with a growing gap, and a Cancel that drops back to the server list.
