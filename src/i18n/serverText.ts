/**
 * THE SERVER'S OWN SENTENCES.
 *
 * OpenMU writes its player messages as finished English
 * (`GameLogic/Properties/PlayerMessage.resx`) and sends them as a
 * `ServerMessage` packet, so they arrive already worded and know nothing about
 * the language the player picked. The server can localize them itself -
 * `/language` switches `player.Culture` - but only into the cultures it was
 * built with, and it ships English alone.
 *
 * So the recognising happens here. Every sentence the server can send is a
 * `serverMessage.*` line in `recipes.ts`, worded exactly as OpenMU words it,
 * which lets the English catalogue double as the pattern that matches the
 * incoming text: one place to fix when a server upgrade rewords a message.
 *
 * A line that matches nothing is returned untouched. GM broadcasts, guild
 * notices, a message a newer server grew - free text stays free text rather
 * than turning into a blank or a key.
