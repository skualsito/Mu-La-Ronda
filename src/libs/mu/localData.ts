/**
 * `Data/Local/<pack>/…` - the original client's own localisation.
 *
 * Webzen shipped one folder per language under `Data/Local/`, with the language
 * tag in every file name: `Eng/Quest_eng.bmd`, `Spn/Quest_spn.bmd`,
 * `Por/Quest_por.bmd`. That is where the quest names, the NPC dialogue scripts,
 * the warp list and the master-skill tooltips live - text the client does not
 * write itself and so is not in `i18n/recipes.ts`.
 *
 * This resolves one of those files for the active language and falls back to
 * English **per file**, so a pack that is only half there still gives its half.
 * The packs are not consistent about the case of the base name (`MoveReq_por`
 * but `movereq_spn`, `Text_spn` but `text_por`), so each candidate is tried in
 * the spelling asked for and all lower case; NTFS does not care, a static host
 * usually does.
 *
 * Which pack a language uses is `dataPack` on its `LanguageLayer`; a language
 * without one reads English here and is still fully translated everywhere
 * `t()` reaches.
