/**
 * The room mask (ARCHITECTURE §13 F8): the one writer of "outside the room is
 * black". One post pass on tiers >= 1 while an area with a volume is active,
 * after the haze and before the post chain, whatever the post-processing
 * option says. Per pixel the world position comes back from the shared depth
 * and is drawn iff it lies inside the room volume (the floor between the inner
 * wall faces, up to the roof underside) or the segment from the camera to it
 * leaves the wall box (the same floor, up to the wall top) through one of its
 * four sides: that is a view through a door or a window, and a solid wall
 * would have stopped the ray. The two faces that stop nothing are the roof,
 * which is lifted out of the way while the hero is inside, and the floor,
 * which is one-sided and writes no depth from below - so a ray over the wall
 * top reaches the world outside and a ray up through the ground reaches all
 * of it, and neither is an opening. Hence the two asymmetries: only the exit
 * face has to be a wall (a camera above may drop its rays in through the
 * missing roof), and a camera below the floor gets no crossing at all. The
 * box stops at the inner faces, so a wall's outer face and its top lie
 * outside and go black with the exterior. Cards that write no depth take the
 * depth behind them, so a flame over the floor stays and a torch outside the
 * walls goes with the exterior behind it.
 *
 * The depth is the pass's own renderer, enabled for the camera while a room
 * is active and released when the area ends, storing camera-space z. Not the
 * G-buffer: that one refuses a map object's alpha-keyed cards on purpose, and
 * a tavern's barrels, stools and racks are all of them.
 *
 * Dev seam: off unless `?roomMask=1` (Mu La Ronda, see `forcedOff`).
