/**
 * Who is connected right now, answered on loopback.
 *
 * OpenMU keeps login state in memory only (`LoginServer.cs` is a plain
 * `Dictionary<string, byte>`), so nothing in its database says who is playing.
 * The proxy is the one process that knows: every browser client reaches the
 * game server through it, so a live websocket *is* a live session.
 *
 * The cash shop's safety gate asks this before writing to an account, because
 * writing to one that is loaded in the game server's memory either dupes the
 * jewels it spends or corrupts the inventory slot it writes. This is only
 * authoritative while the game server's TCP port is unreachable from outside -
 * a player on the original .exe would bypass the proxy entirely - which is why
 * the gate probes that port itself rather than trusting the answer here alone.
 *
 * Keys are Season 6's. A version with different SimpleModulus keys would
 * decode nothing here and every account would read as offline, so the gate
 * treats "no login ever seen on a live socket" as a reason to refuse rather
 * than a reason to proceed.
 *
 * A socket is named by the game server, not by the client. The login frame
 * the client sends is a claim - anyone can put any name in one - so it is
 * only held as pending until the server's `LoginResponse` comes back the
 * other way, and only an Okay turns it into this connection's account. A
 * wrong password, an unknown account, a full server: the claim is dropped
 * and the socket stays nameless. That is the whole reason the sniffer reads
 * both directions.
 *
 * `/ticket/<nonce>` is strictly more sensitive than `/presence/<account>`.
 * Presence says whether a name is playing, which anyone standing next to the
 * player could tell. The ticket route turns a nonce the browser chose for
 * itself (src/common/sessionNonce.ts, sent on the socket URL by
 * `createSocket`) into the account that logged in over it, and the cash shop
 * signs that answer into a bearer ticket: whoever can reach this server with
 * a nonce in hand is that account in the shop. Loopback-only is not tidiness
 * for that route, it is the whole authentication.
